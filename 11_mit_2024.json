Students examine engineering case studies alongside key readings by foundational ethical thinkers from Aristotle to Martin Luther King, Jr., and investigate which ethical approaches are best and how to apply them. Topics include justice, rights, cost-benefit analysis, safety, bias, genetic engineering, climate change, and the promise and peril of AI. Discussion-based, with the aim of introducing students to new ways of thinking. All sections cover the same core ethical frameworks, but some sections have a particular focus for case studies, such as bioengineering, or have an in-depth emphasis on particular thinkers. The subject is taught in separate sections. Students are eligible to take any section regardless of their registered subject number. For 20.005, students additionally undertake an ethical-technical analysis of a BE-related topic of their choosing. Fall: B. L. Trout, P. Hansen, D. Lauffenburger, K. Hansen Spring: P. Hansen, L.

First, the physical bases for strength, stiffness, and ductility are discussed with reference to crystallography, defects, and microstructure. Second, phase transformations and microstructural evolution are studied in the context of alloy thermodynamics and kinetics. Together, these components comprise the modern paradigm for designing metallic microstructures for optimized properties. Concludes with a focus on processing-microstructure-property relationships in structural engineering alloys. Students taking the graduate version explore the subject in greater depth. R. Freitas No textbook information available 3.41 Colloids, Surfaces, Absorption, Capillarity, and Wetting Phenomena ( ) Prereq: 3.20 and 3.21 Units: 3-0-9 Integrates elements of physics and chemistry toward the study of material surfaces. Begins with classical colloid phenomena and the interaction between surfaces in different media. Discusses the mechanisms of surface charge generation as well as how dispersion forces are created and controlled. Continues with exploration of chemical absorption processes and surface design of inorganic and organic materials. Includes examples in which such surface design can be used to control critical properties of materials in applications. Addresses lastly how liquids interact with solids as viewed by capillarity and wetting phenomena. Studies how materials are used in processes and applications that are intended to control liquids, and how the surface chemistry and structure of those materials makes such applications possible. M. Cima"
