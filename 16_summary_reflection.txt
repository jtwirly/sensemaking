# Summary of Key Findings

1. **Discontinued Subjects**: 
   - A significant number of subjects offered in 1996 were discontinued by 2024.
   - Discontinued subjects span a wide range of departments and topics.
   - Many specialized engineering, niche humanities/social science, and graduate-level seminars were among those discontinued.
   - This may reflect fields that became less relevant or were consolidated into other subjects.

2. **New Subjects**:
   - Many new subjects were introduced by 2024, focusing on cutting-edge fields and interdisciplinary topics.
   - Notable areas of growth include computer science, AI/ML, data science, biological engineering, and neuroscience.
   - New subjects emphasize hands-on projects, design, entrepreneurship, and real-world applications.
   - There is an increased focus on the societal impact and ethical considerations of technology.

3. **Curriculum Breadth**:
   - The overall breadth of fields covered in the curriculum remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease in the number of unique departments.
   - However, there was a modest increase in the percentage of explicitly interdisciplinary course titles.
   - Interdisciplinarity may be more prevalent than course titles suggest, especially in 2024, but this is difficult to confirm without analyzing course descriptions.

4. **Structural Changes**:
   - The introduction of 6-digit course numbers allowed for an expanded range of subjects.
   - There was an increase in project-based, independent study, and research-focused subjects.
   - Subjects related to current global challenges, such as climate change, sustainability, and clean energy, became more prominent.

# Reflections on Broader Trends

The changes observed in the MIT course catalog from 1996 to 2024 reflect broader shifts in education and industry:

1. **Emphasis on Interdisciplinary and Emerging Fields**: 
   - The rise of subjects in areas like data science, AI, and bioengineering aligns with the increasing importance of these fields in research and industry.
   - Employers increasingly value graduates with interdisciplinary skills who can tackle complex, real-world problems.

2. **Integration of Technology and Society**: 
   - The introduction of subjects that examine the societal impact and ethical dimensions of technology reflects a growing recognition of the need for responsible innovation.
   - As technology becomes more pervasive, it is crucial for students to consider its broader implications.

3. **Project-Based and Experiential Learning**: 
   - The increase in hands-on, project-based subjects mirrors a shift towards experiential learning in higher education.
   - Employers seek graduates with practical skills and the ability to apply knowledge to real-world challenges.

4. **Adaptation to Global Challenges**: 
   - The prominence of subjects related to climate change, sustainability, and clean energy reflects the growing urgency of these issues.
   - Universities are increasingly focusing on preparing students to address pressing global challenges.

5. **Lifelong Learning and Upskilling**: 
   - The discontinuation of some specialized subjects and the introduction of others may reflect the need for continuous learning and upskilling in a rapidly changing world.
   - As industries evolve, universities must adapt their curricula to provide students with relevant knowledge and skills.

Overall, the changes in the MIT course catalog showcase the institution's efforts to keep pace with the evolving needs of students, research, and industry. By emphasizing interdisciplinary learning, real-world applications, and societal impact, MIT is preparing graduates to tackle the complex challenges of the 21st century.
